      Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes
      ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who
      plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter
      Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the
      greatest players in history, Messi has set numerous records for individual
      accolades won throughout his professional footballing career, including
      eight Ballons d'Or, six European Golden Shoes, and eight times being named
      the world's best player by FIFA.[note 2] In 2025, he was named the All
      Time Men's World Best Player by the IFFHS. He is the most decorated player
      in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies.[note
      3] Messi's records include most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals
      for a single club (672 for Barcelona), most goals in La Liga (474), most
      goal contributions in the FIFA World Cup (21), and most goal contributions
      in the Copa América (32). A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker,
      Messi has scored more than 870 senior career goals and has provided more
      than 380 assists for club and country.[21] Messi made his competitive
      debut for Barcelona at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established
      himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first
      uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the
      first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first
      of four consecutive Ballon d'Ors, and by the 2011–12 season he set the
      European record for most goals in a season and established himself as
      Barcelona's all-time top scorer. During the 2014–15 campaign, where he
      became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, he led Barcelona to a historic
      second treble, leading to a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. He assumed
      Barcelona's captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019.
      At Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga
      titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at
      Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in
      August 2021, where he won the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons
      there. He joined MLS club Inter Miami in July 2023. An Argentine
      international, Messi is the national team's all-time leading goalscorer
      and most-capped player. Several years after his senior debut in 2005, he
      won the gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Assuming captaincy in
      2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 World Cup,
      the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they
      would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in
      2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 World
      Cup. Messi was central to ending Argentina's 28-year trophy drought by
      winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon
      d'Or that year. In the following year, he led Argentina to winning the
      2022 World Cup, the country's first in 36 years. This followed with a
      record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023. Messi was victorious at the
      2024 Copa América, his third major international title. Messi has endorsed
      sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was
      the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009
      and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in
      2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the
      world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus
      World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In
      2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second
      footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career
      earnings. Following his arrival and impact on football in the US, Messi
      was named Time's Athlete of the Year in 2023, and was bestowed with the
      Presidential Medal of Freedom by US president Joe Biden in 2025.
